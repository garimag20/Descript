# Tweak
The one-stop shop audio editing platform.

Say youâ€™re all set to post your voice notes/podcasts online. However, you mispronounced a few words, stuttered twice, missed out on an important point, and unknowingly cussed once. Oops! But who has the time to go through the grind of recording all over again, right? 
No worries! Meet Tweak, a value-added audio-editor with transcription, deletion and over-dubbing features to get your message across precisely and purposefully.

While many tools are available with similar functionality, they are often not user-friendly. TWEAK makes audio editing fun while providing an added functionality of audio cloning which helps you fix mistakes easily and seamlessly.

Features: 
1. Transcription & Timestamp for each word in the given audio.
2. Printing the occurrence of each word in the transcription.
3. Deletion of a word.
4. Deletion of a phrase/paragraph.
5. Insertion of word/phrase.
